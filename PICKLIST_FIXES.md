# Picklist Generator Fixes

## Issue Summary

The picklist generator service was failing due to the following issues:

1. GPT-4o was producing duplicate teams in the response, often repeating the same 8 teams over and over instead of ranking all 75 teams
2. The pattern of repetition caused broken JSON responses with unterminated strings
3. The previous JSON format was still using too many tokens even with the compact format

## Changes Made

### 1. System and User Prompts Enhancements

- Added explicit instructions not to repeat teams
- Added multiple examples with different team numbers to avoid fixation on specific teams
- Emphasized that each team must appear exactly once
- Enhanced verification steps to check for duplicates
- Improved overflow handling instructions
- Added validation checklists with specific checks

### 2. Duplicate Detection and Handling

- Added code to calculate the percentage of duplicate teams in the response
- Added pattern detection to identify repeating sequences
- Added early termination with a user-friendly error if extreme duplication is detected
- Added truncation logic to use only the first instance of a repeating pattern
- Enhanced the response parser to skip duplicates

### 3. Improved Error Messages

- Added explicit error message to suggest using fewer teams when model enters a loop
- Added better logging of duplication percentages and patterns
- Enhanced diagnostic information in logs

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was likely caused by:

1. **Token Limits**: Despite the compact format, GPT-4o was hitting token limits with 75 teams
2. **Model Behavior**: When approaching token limits, the model began repeating teams instead of properly handling the overflow condition
3. **Example Influence**: The examples we provided influenced the model to fixate on specific team numbers

## Usage Recommendations

1. **Batch Processing**: Process teams in smaller batches (20-25 at a time) rather than all 75 at once
2. **Monitor Duplication**: Watch for duplication warnings in the logs which indicate model repetition
3. **Check Completeness**: Verify that all teams were ranked or identify which ones are missing

The changes should make the picklist generator more robust by:
- Detecting repetition patterns early
- Providing clearer feedback when limits are hit
- Better deduplicating responses even when the model repeats teams
