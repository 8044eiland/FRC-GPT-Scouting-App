INSTRUCTIONS:
1. You must rank {len(teams_data)} teams that are MISSING from the picklist.
2. Each team must appear EXACTLY ONCE in your output. NO duplicates!
3. Insert the teams based on their strength relative to the already ranked teams.
4. Use the ALREADY_RANKED_TEAMS list as a reference for ranking quality.

ALREADY_RANKED_TEAMS = {json.dumps(top_ranked)}

TEAMS_TO_RANK = {json.dumps(teams_data)}

Return a JSON object with a "p" array using this ultra-compact format:
{{"p":[[team,score,"â‰¤12 words"]...],"s":"ok"}}

The "p" array should contain only the MISSING_TEAM_NUMBERS teams, NOT the ALREADY_RANKED_TEAMS.
