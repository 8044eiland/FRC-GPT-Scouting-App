# Database Migration Guide

This guide explains how to run database migrations for schema changes.

## Current Migrations

### 1. LockedPicklist Table Migration (May 2025)

This migration adds two new columns to the `locked_picklists` table:
- `excluded_teams`: Stores teams that were excluded from picklist consideration
- `strategy_prompts`: Stores the original strategy prompts used to generate priorities

These additions ensure that when events are archived, they include all relevant data from the picklist generation process.

## Running the Migration

To run the migration:

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Run the migration script:
   ```bash
   python migrate_locked_picklist.py
   ```

3. Verify the migration completed successfully:
   - Check for the "âœ… Migration completed successfully" message
   - Review the generated log file in the same directory

## How Migrations Work

The migration scripts use SQLite's ALTER TABLE command to add new columns to existing tables. The process is designed to be:

1. **Non-destructive**: Existing data is preserved
2. **Idempotent**: Safe to run multiple times (will not add columns that already exist)
3. **Backward compatible**: Default values are provided for new columns

## Notes for Developers

When adding new columns to database models:

1. Update the model in `app/database/models.py`
2. Create a migration script if the table already exists in production
3. Test the migration in a development environment before applying to production
4. Document the migration in this file

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during migration:

1. Check the generated log file for detailed error messages
2. Ensure the database is not locked by another process
3. Verify you have write permissions to the database file
