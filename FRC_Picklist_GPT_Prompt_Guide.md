Thought for 14 seconds
You read the log exactly right:

finish_reason="length" tells us the model hit the max‑tokens ceiling and was cut off mid‑sentence.

Because it was truncated, the closing brackets never arrived → the JSON parser blew up.

Your regex salvage routine then yanked the 68 team objects that were fully intact, dropped dupes, and you finally wound up with just 20 unique teams.

So the root problem is output size—not rate‑limits or the model “forgetting” teams.

Why it overflowed
Piece	Approx. tokens / team	With 75 teams
JSON keys (team_number, etc.)	6 tokens	450
Nickname (avg. 2 words)	4 tokens	300
Reasoning (your sample ≈ 16 words)	≈ 30 tokens	2 250
Structure + header	—	100

Total ≈ 3 100 tokens
GPT‑4o allows up to 4 096 output tokens, so in theory you should be safe.
But:

The model often adds line breaks, indentation, or repeats objects if it gets interrupted, which pushes you over the edge.

The string "Cerbotics - Peñoles" slipped in a NUL byte (\u0000) → invalid JSON even if the output had finished.

Quick fixes that usually solve it
Change	Why it helps
Cap reasoning length to ≤ 12 words (≈ 18 tokens).	Saves ~900 tokens.
Drop nickname or make it optional ("" allowed).	Saves ~300 tokens.
Tell the model to output minified JSON (no spaces / newlines).	Shaves 10‑15 %.
Add response_format={"type":"json_object"} if you’re not already using it.	The model will self‑correct bad quotes/NULs.
Raise max_tokens to 3500–3700 – the default might be lower than you think.	Gives more head‑room.
Fail‑safe suffix: “If you can’t fit all 75 teams, return {"status":"overflow"} instead of partial data.”	Prevents half‑JSON.

A pared‑down schema that nearly always fits:

{
  "picklist":[
    {"team":2481,"rank":1,"reason":"EPA 99.4, top tele‑auto blend"},
    ...
  ],
  "status":"ok"
}
5 keys × 2 tokens ≈ 10 tokens / team

12‑word reason ≈ 18 tokens / team

→ ~28 tokens / team × 75 = 2 100 tokens

Invariant rules:
1. Exactly 75 objects, no duplicates.
2. Use the **compact schema**: {"team":0,"rank":0,"reason":""}
3. `reason` ≤ 12 words. No nickname field required.
4. Respond in **minified JSON** (no whitespace).
5. If output would exceed the token limit, respond ONLY with {"status":"overflow"}.

USER …
Set max_tokens=2500.
If you ever get "overflow", rerun asking only for the missing teams (rare).
